# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately to security@sicar.io. Include a clear description, potential impact, and steps to reproduce. Do not publicly disclose details until we confirm and release a fix.

We aim to acknowledge reports within three business days and provide status updates as the investigation progresses. Good-faith, coordinated disclosure is appreciated, and we will credit reporters when appropriate.
