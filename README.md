## Before you open an issue

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Use the appropriate template:
   - Bug Report
   - Question
   - Feedback / Feature Request
3. Include clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual result, and relevant screenshots or short video.
4. Do not include personal data, payment information, or secrets. If you believe you found a security or cheating vulnerability, do not open a public issue—see **Security** below.

## Categories and labels

We use labels to route and prioritize:
- `bug`, `question`, `feedback`
- `severity:critical`, `severity:high`, `severity:medium`, `severity:low`
- `area:gameplay`, `area:ui`, `area:graphics`, `area:audio`, `area:network`, `area:performance`, `area:accessibility`, `area:localization`
- `platform:windows`, `platform:macos`, `platform:linux`
- `browser:chrome`, `browser:edge`, `browser:firefox`, `browser:safari`
- `status:needs-triage`, `status:need-info`, `status:investigating`, `status:accepted`, `status:in-progress`, `status:fixed`, `status:duplicate`, `status:wontfix`, `status:cannot-repro`

Severity guidance:
- **Critical** – crash or cannot play; data loss; account blocking issues
- **High** – major gameplay or service disruption without a reliable workaround
- **Medium** – affects play but has a reasonable workaround
- **Low** – cosmetic or minor usability
